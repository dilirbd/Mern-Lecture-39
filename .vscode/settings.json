    // the above line works too, instead of the line below to remove the yellowlines under tailwind syntax keywords coming from vscode's built-in css validator. This is because it would make the built-in one ignore all unknown at-rules but stylelint being active here would cause the truly unknown/invalid ones to still get caught by stylelint. Just `"css.validate": false` would work too as, again, stylelint is active here and is superior to the built-in validator. It would catch any truly unknown/invalid @ rules.
